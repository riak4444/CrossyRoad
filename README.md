# CrossyRoad

This is my 2D version of Crossy Road. The chicken (player) is moved using the arrow keys, and the goal is to get to the other side by passing all the obstacles. The obstacles include cars driving back and forth, a train that comes at random times and random speeds, and passing over water by moving logs. To win, the player must reach the other side three times, and they have five chances.

CrossyRoad.java is the driver.

There is much room for improvement because I had very intro-level programming knowledge when I made this game. I do plan on making a Crossy Road 2 with better code.
